    "query": "What is machine learning?",
    "context": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves. The core principle is that machines can learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.",
    "answer": "Machine learning is a type of AI that allows computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time without explicit programming.",
    "ground_truth": "Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn from experience and improve automatically."
  },
  {
    "query": "What is deep learning?",
    "context": "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers (hence 'deep'). These neural networks attempt to simulate the behavior of the human brain, allowing computer systems to cluster data and make predictions with incredible accuracy. Deep learning is particularly effective for tasks like image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing.",
    "answer": "Deep learning uses multi-layer neural networks to learn from data, similar to how the human brain processes information.",
    "ground_truth": "Deep learning is a machine learning technique using multi-layered neural networks to process complex patterns."
  },
  {
    "query": "What is natural language processing?",
    "context": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It involves programming computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. NLP combines computational linguistics with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a valuable way.",
    "answer": "NLP helps computers understand and process human language using AI and machine learning techniques.",
    "ground_truth": "NLP is AI technology for processing and understanding human language through computational methods."
  },
  {
    "query": "What is computer vision?",
    "context": "Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world. Using digital images from cameras and videos and deep learning models, machines can accurately identify and classify objects, and then react to what they 'see'. Computer vision is used in applications ranging from facial recognition to autonomous vehicles.",
    "answer": "Computer vision allows machines to see and understand images using deep learning and image processing.",
    "ground_truth": "Computer vision enables computers to interpret visual data from images and videos using AI."
  },
  {
    "query": "What is reinforcement learning?",
    "context": "Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties and learns to navigate the environment through trial and error. This approach is inspired by behavioral psychology and is particularly useful for tasks like game playing, robotics, and resource management.",
    "answer": "Reinforcement learning is when AI learns by trial and error to maximize rewards through interactions with an environment.",
    "ground_truth": "Reinforcement learning is a ML technique where agents learn optimal behaviors through reward-based feedback."
